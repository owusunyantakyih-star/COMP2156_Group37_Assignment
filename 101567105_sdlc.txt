The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used to design, develop, test, and deploy software.
DevOps plays an important role in SDLC by improving collaboration and automation at every stage of the lifecycle.

In the planning and development stages, DevOps ensures better communication between teams. During testing, automated testing tools help identify bugs quickly.

Continuous Integration (CI) allows developers to merge code frequently, while Continuous Deployment (CD) enables automatic deployment of updates.

DevOps makes the SDLC faster, more efficient, and more reliable by reducing manual work and improving software quality.
