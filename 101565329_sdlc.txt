The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and maintain software applications. It includes stages such as planning, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
DevOps improves the SDLC by introducing automation, continuous integration, and faster feedback loops. This allows teams to deliver high-quality software more efficiently.
