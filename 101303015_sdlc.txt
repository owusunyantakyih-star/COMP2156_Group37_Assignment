The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used to design, develop, test, and maintain software. 
It includes phases such as planning, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

Understanding SDLC helps teams deliver high-quality software efficiently.

DevOps plays an important role in SDLC by automating tasks and improving collaboration.

This structured approach helps teams manage software projects more effectively.
